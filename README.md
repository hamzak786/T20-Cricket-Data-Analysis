# T20-Cricket-Data-Analysis
A T20 cricket data analysis project using Python and Power BI involves utilizing Python for data processing, analysis, and initial visualization and then integrating the results into Power BI for creating interactive dashboards and reports. Below is a detailed breakdown of the project:

### 1. Data Collection:

- **Sources:**
  - Extract data from reliable cricket databases, APIs, or CSV files.
  - Examples of APIs: Cricket API, ESPNcricinfo API.

### 2. Data Preprocessing using Python:

- **Cleaning and Formatting:**
  - Handle missing data, outliers, and errors.
  - Standardize column names, and ensure consistency.
  - Convert data types as needed.

- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Create new features like strike rates, economy rates, player averages, etc.

- **Data Integration:**
  - Merge data from different sources if necessary.
  - Aggregate data at the required level (player, team, match).

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python:

- **Player Analysis:**
  - Visualize batting and bowling statistics.
  - Use matplotlib and seaborn for heatmaps, histograms, and scatter plots.

- **Team Analysis:**
  - Explore win-loss records, average team scores, etc.
  - Visualize trends using line charts and bar graphs.

- **Match Analysis:**
  - Identify correlations between variables.
  - Explore trends in scores and wickets over different seasons.

### 4. Statistical Analysis using Python:

- **Hypothesis Testing:**
  - Conduct hypothesis tests related to player performance, team strategies, etc.

- **Regression Analysis:**
  - Build regression models to predict match outcomes.
  - Identify factors influencing scores.

### 5. Data Visualization and Initial Reporting using Python:

- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:**
  - Create static visualizations for initial insights.
  - Save visualizations as images for later integration.

### 6. Integration with Power BI:

- **Connect Python Script to Power BI:**
  - Use Python script visuals in Power BI to run Python code.
  - Import the processed data into Power BI.

### 7. Data Modeling and Transformation in Power BI:

- **Power Query Editor:**
  - Further clean and transform data within Power BI.
  - Create relationships between different tables.

### 8. Visualization in Power BI:

- **Create Dashboards:**
  - Use Power BI's drag-and-drop interface to create interactive dashboards.
  - Include visuals like line charts, bar graphs, and tables.

- **Dynamic Filters:**
  - Implement slicers and filters for dynamic analysis.
  - Allow users to interact with the data.

- **Custom Visuals:**
  - Incorporate custom visuals for unique insights.
  - Examples include KPI indicators and advanced charts.

### 9. Machine Learning Integration:

- **Predictive Modeling:**
  - If relevant, integrate machine learning models created in Python into Power BI.

### 10. Report Generation:

- **Create Summary and Insights:**
  - Summarize key findings and insights.
  - Develop a narrative for the data story.

### 11. Documentation:

- **Document the Process:**
  - Provide clear documentation on data sources, preprocessing steps, analysis, and visualization techniques.

### 12. Presentation:

- **Create a Power BI Report:**
  - Use Power BI's reporting capabilities to create a compelling and interactive report.

### 13. Future Work:

- **Suggestions for Further Analysis:**
  - Identify areas for future exploration within Power BI or through enhanced Python scripts.

By combining the strengths of Python for data analysis and Power BI for visualization, this project allows for a comprehensive exploration of T20 cricket data, providing valuable insights for cricket enthusiasts, teams, and analysts.
